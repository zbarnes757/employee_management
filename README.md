# Summary

This was born out of the suggested practice problems from the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-03-hash-maps.html#summary).
I will likely be adding more and more as my understanding of Rust improves.

# To Use

Make sure you have Rust [installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Then just use `cargo run`. Easy, peasy.

# Learning Goals

- [ ] Tests
- [x] Modular system
- [x] Structs and OOP
